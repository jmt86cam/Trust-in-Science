## Trust in Science - what data do we rely on in a pandemic?

This project aims to explore where individuals, primarily at the University of Cambridge and TU Delft, are finding the latest data on the Covid-19 pandemic. We designed a survey to be completed here and analysis of the results from this will be published at the end of the year.

### Link to the survey

### Open source data and dashboards on the Covid-19 pandemic

If completing the survey has inspired you to go find more open source data to keep track of the pandemic then some useful resources may include:

### Research into peoples trust in Science

Trust in Science is a topical issue and suffered a worrying decline in recent years. There is an abundance of resources available to find out more, here are just a few for you to check out:
