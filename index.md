# Trust in Science - what data do we rely on in a pandemic?

This project aims to explore where individuals, primarily at the University of Cambridge and TU Delft, are finding the latest data on the Covid-19 pandemic. We designed a survey to be completed [here](https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_094DWDvWZ3wpkax) and analysis of the results from this will be published at the end of the year.

### Open source data and dashboards on the Covid-19 pandemic

If completing the survey has inspired you to go find more open source data to keep track of the pandemic then some useful resources may include:

### Research into peoples trust in Science

Trust in Science is a topical issue, there is an abundance of resources available to find out more, here are just a few for you to check out:

- [The Wellcome Global Monitor 2018](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) looked at attitudes towards Science and Health and produced the largest report of its kind  
- UKRI commissioned Ipsos-MORI to monitor the [public's attitude towards Science](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/ukri-research-how-has-covid-19-affected-trust-scientists) during the pandemic with significant crossover to the survey asked here. They report most people get the latest updates from major broadcasters and that these are widely trusted. 
- [Germany's Wissenschaft barometer](https://www.wissenschaft-im-dialog.de/projekte/wissenschaftsbarometer/) carries out annual surveys into the public's attitude towards science and research. They did a special edition for coronavirus this year. 
- A recent summit of the G7 Science academies prepared a [summary and recommendations on Science and trust](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/about-us/international/g-science-statements/2019-g7-declaration-science-and-trust.pdf?la=en-GB&hash=32D575A44FA381AB16B9ADF762FA99FB) where they highlight the need for education, communication and for research to be ethical and evaluated on its quality, reproducibility and originality. 
- Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway dissect campaigns that set out to mislead the public in their book [“Merchants of Doubt”](https://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/). Exposing how ideologies and an overly-compliant media skewed the public's understanding of key issues. 
- [This report](https://www.researchamerica.org/sites/default/files/ReleaseDeckAugSurvey100820-5.pdf) from a survey conducted by Zogby Analytics on behalf of Research!America shows broad bipartisan support for a stronger focus on Science, even during a time of great division in the U.S.A. 
- [Risky Talk](https://riskytalk.libsyn.com/about) is a podcast presented by Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter. The podcast invites some of the world's foremost experts in risk and evidence communication to discuss practical challenges on how best to present risk and Scientific evidence meaningfully.
- Baroness Onora O’Neill is a philosopher examining trust and how we judge trustworthiness to know where to put it. She has published [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09672559.2018.1454637?casa_token=jNRQAZDCmY0AAAAA%3AR821ugQ4_0g-czQy4qPo3mC-CtLZZMYMsuTAmy14Fv0qb3uXzEIZcY7Qrh5ncg3_N_-70FXyQNlrRco) and also gave a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/onora_o_neill_what_we_don_t_understand_about_trust?language=en#t-573675) on what we don’t understand about trust.
