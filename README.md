# Trust-in-Science

This repository presents results from a survey conducted in December 2020, reaching 84 participants who primarily worked or studied at the University of Cambirdge or TU Delft. The aim was to identify how much they trust information they receive about the SARS CoV2 pandemic, where they receive their information from and how much they use open source data to come to their own conclusions.

The results of this are presented as a GitHub pages site and the R code used to analyse the survey is also available.

The survey was conducted as part of an internship with TU Delft library whilst studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge.
